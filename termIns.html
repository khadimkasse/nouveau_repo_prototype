        The term insurance is a kind of temporary "whole life insurance".<br/> Temporary because it reamins in force for a specified term of years.<br/>
        You're paid a capital at the end of the year of your death, if it occurs before the end of the term period. If you live above the term, then you don't get any benefit.<br/>
        
        we denote it <sub>n</sub>A<sub>x</sub> and : <br/>
        
        <sub>n</sub>A<sub>x</sub> = C*&sum;<sub>k = 0: n-1</sub> v<sup>k+1</sup>* <sub>k|1</sub>q<sub>x</sub>. where v is the discount factor<br/>
        v = 1/(1+ the interest rate).<br/>
        C is the benefit <br/>
