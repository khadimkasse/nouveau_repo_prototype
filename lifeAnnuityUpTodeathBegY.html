        Life annuity due at the beginning of the year payable up to the death
        is an insurance contract that pays an amount at the beginning of each year up to the death of the insured.<br/>
        We have mathematically :<br/>
        &auml;<sub>x</sub> = C*&sum;<sub>k = 0 to &omega; -x</sub> <sub>k</sub>E<sub>x</sub><br/>
        
        Where <sub>k</sub>E<sub>x</sub> is the amount given by the <a href="pureEndowment.html">pure endowment</a>, <br/>
        and C is the capital due.
