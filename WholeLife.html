       A Whole life Insurance contract is a contract whose the trigger of the payment of a capital is the death.<br/>
        You pay (annual) premiums and once you die, the one you choose as beneficiary gets the amount of money you sign for in the contract.<br/> 
         As long as you are alive, nobody will get the benefit of the contract.<br/>
        
        It is computed as :<br/>
        A<sub>x</sub> = C* &sum;<sub>k=0: &omega;-x-1</sub> v<sup>k+1</sup> * d<sub>x+k</sub> &frasl; l<sub>x</sub><br/>
        Where v is called the discount factor, used to compute the present value of cash flows.<br/>
        C is the capital <br/>
        v = 1/ (1+ the interest rate)
