           q<sub>&omega;</sub>= 1
            where q<sub>&omega;</sub> is the probability of death at the last generation of the population studied : the probaility to die at the last age is certain<br/>
            furthermore, we have the relation p<sub>x</sub>+q<sub>x</sub> = 1. Hence q<sub>x</sub> = 1 since the probability to live above &omega; is 0<br/>
            &omega; is the last generation age of the mortality table.
