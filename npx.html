            <sub>n</sub>p<sub>x</sub>= l<sub>x+n</sub> &frasl; l<sub>x</sub><br/>
            where <sub>n</sub>p<sub>x</sub> is the probability of survival between x and x+n.<br/>
           the  l<sub>x</sub> are the number of people alive at age x.
        
            It can also be viewed this way as the probability of life after n years : you live from age x to age x+1 and from age x+1 to age x+2 and so on until age x+n. Hence it can be computed like : p<sub>x</sub> * p<sub>x+1</sub> * ... * p<sub>x+n-1</sub>.<br/>
